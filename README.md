# Yaw-reactive : functionally reactively program your own (simple) 3D games!

**(ultimately) a 3D live-coding experience for Clojurians of all ages**

(based on the `yaw-engine` 3d engine...)

## Disclaimer

Yaw is *not yet* usable, except for extremely simplistic examples!

## Requirements

 - Clojure 1.8+
 - Java : 1.8 +
 - Leiningen 2.7.1+
 - LWJGL 3.0+ (via Hello_jgl, thanks !)

## How to start ?

There are two examples in `examples/yaw-reactive`, simply evaluate them in your favorite Clojure env... and try to figure out how things work

(there will be a documentation at some point)...

...Maybe this does not work on a Mac because of a fruit (please PR fixes!)

----

Enjoy!
