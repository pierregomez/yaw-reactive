;; ## Component render
;;
;; We say that a component is rendered when the scene it described
;; is produced, which means that all its children component must
;; also be rendered. This is of course obtained by invoking
;; the component and its subcomponents.
;;
;; Components are invoked on two distinct occasions:
;;
;;  1. when a parent component invoke them
;;  2. when a signal handler invoke them directly (cf. the signal handler section)
;;
;; For performance reason, you do not want to render the component
;; too often. 
;;
;; The (reagent inspired) philosophy here is: if the arguments of a component
;; do not change between two calls, then we do not have to render it, we can
;; just reuse its previous value.
;;}

;;{
;; Inside the controller map, the components are all listed under
;; the key `:components`. If is a map with the component references
;; as keys and an information map as value. Initially the map is empty.
;; if it is not empty, then it corresponds to save values of arguments
;; so that we can check if something has changed or not...
